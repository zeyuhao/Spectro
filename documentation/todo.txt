To do list:


Future fixes
=======================================
1) Add email verification

2) Add button to remove phone number if desired

3) Fix phone validation function

4) Add capitalization function to names

5) Add tab to login screen that can quickly switch to signup page (see ebay's signin screen)

6) Get dynamic loading of navbar to work - added extra table for account_pages

7) Redirect users to page they clicked on after logging in - use session variables?

8) Create page for users to access their "starred items" (items they are interested in)

9) Make listing description a blurb if length is longer than x words

10) Add preventative measures for listings (e.g max price cap, regex for illegal items)

11) Fix navbar highlighting for when users click on signin page

12) Allow users to multiselect listings to delete

13) Allow users to post listings even if their thumbnail image does not upload - allow them to add a thumbnail image later

14) Add image upload meter (visually show upload progress)

15) Do error messages for account-settings page



Most important
=======================================
1) Allow users to edit their listings

2) Allow users to upload images for their listings besides thumbnail

3) randomize uploaded image file names so duplicate images can be uploaded by multiple users
